# sis-STEM-website
This is a website idea I am developing to help young women explore STEM careers. It's a work in progress and is currently at about version 0.7

#Features
sis-STEM has 3 main features: 
- A Javascript quiz that looks at the user's subject area interests, personal aptitudes and habits and recommends a STEM field to explore
- A Google Map to detect the user's location and display available mentors in the area (all of the mentors at the moment are placeholders)
- A contact form which validates on blur

#Development
I am currently working on the following: 
- Cleaning up the quiz code and replacing some repetition with loops and functions
- Introducing a feature that will automatically scroll the user's window up to the map as soon as a mentor has been selected from the list

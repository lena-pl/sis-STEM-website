# sis-STEM-website
This is a website idea I am developing to help young women explore STEM careers. It's a work in progress and is currently at about version 0.7

#Design
Here is a link to the design of the site and some of the thinking behind it on my Behance page:

#Features
sis-STEM has 3 main features: 
- A Javascript quiz that looks at the user's subject area interests, personal aptitudes and habits and recommends a STEM field to explore
- A Google Map to detect the user's location and display available mentors in the area (all of the mentors at the moment are placeholders)
- A contact form which validates on blur
